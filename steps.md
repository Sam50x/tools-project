# **Web Scraping and Analysis Project - Step-by-Step Guide**

## **Course: DS Tools**

### **Alexandria University - Faculty of Computers and Data Science**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This project involves extracting data from a website, cleaning and processing it using Regular Expressions, analyzing it for insights, visualizing the results, and storing the final data in a database. Optionally, you can deploy an interactive web app using Streamlit.

---

## **2. Project Phases**

### **Phase 1: Project Idea Submission (Deadline: April 15th)**

In this phase, you will define your project idea and submit a brief plan.

#### **Step 1: Choose a Website to Scrape** âœ…

- Select a website that provides useful and structured data.
- Make sure web scraping is legally and ethically allowed for the chosen site.
- Example categories:
  - Job listings (e.g., **Indeed**)
  - E-commerce products (e.g., **Amazon, BooksToScrape**)
  - Movie ratings (e.g., **IMDb**) -> This One
  - Weather data (e.g., **OpenWeather API**)

#### **Step 2: Identify the Data to Extract** âœ…

- Determine the type of data you want to collect.
- Examples:
  - Job postings: **Company name, job title, salary, location**
  - Books: **Title, author, price, rating**
  - Movies: **Title, genre, release year, rating, cast, number of ratings, director** -> This one
  - Weather: **Temperature, humidity, wind speed, forecast**

#### **Step 3: Define the Project Goal** âœ…

- Clearly explain what you aim to achieve with the scraped data.
- Example goals:
  - **Analyze salary trends** in different job markets.
  - **Compare book ratings** to find best-selling categories.
  - **Identify popular, best rated movie genres, actors, and directors** based on ratings, and number of ratings. -> This one

#### **Step 4: Outline the Data Processing Plan** âœ…

- Explain how you will clean and structure the data.
- Mention the use of **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to clean text (e.g., removing symbols, extracting emails, formatting dates).
- Decide how you will store the extracted data (**CSV, JSON, MongoDB**).

#### **Step 5: Explain the Analysis & Visualization Approach** âœ…

- Describe what kind of insights you want to extract (trends, correlations).
- Mention the types of charts you plan to create (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps).
- If applicable, state that you will deploy findings via **Streamlit**.

#### **Step 6: Submit Your Project Idea** â¬œ

- Write a **short proposal** covering the points above.
- Submit your project idea using the [official form](https://forms.office.com/r/FRXDytcjXZ).
- Wait for approval and feedback before moving to Phase 2.

### **Phase 2: Full Implementation (Deadline TBD)**

Once your project idea is approved, you will complete the full implementation following these steps.

---

## **3. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup** â¬œ

1. Install the necessary Python libraries for web scraping, data processing, visualization, and storage.
2. Set up a project directory structure with folders for raw data, scripts, notebooks, visualizations, and database storage.
3. Ensure you have a functional Python environment with all required tools installed.

---

### **Step 2: Data Extraction** â¬œ

1. Analyze the structure of the chosen website using **Inspect Element** in a browser.
2. Identify the specific elements to scrape (e.g., job title, price, rating).
3. Decide whether to use **HTML parsing** or an **API request**.
4. Extract the required data and save it in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

---

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning & Processing** â¬œ

1. Remove unnecessary or incorrect values (e.g., empty entries, duplicates).
2. Standardize text (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove special characters).
3. Use **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to clean and extract useful data:
   - Extract emails, phone numbers, or dates.
   - Clean and structure text fields (e.g., format addresses).
4. Convert data types (e.g., strings to numbers for analysis).

---

### **Step 4: Data Analysis** â¬œ

1. Perform **basic statistical analysis** to understand the dataset.
2. Identify **trends and correlations** in the data.
3. Compute **relevant metrics** like averages, distributions, and frequency counts.
4. Compare your extracted data with external sources if necessary.

---

### **Step 5: Data Visualization** â¬œ

1. Choose **appropriate visualizations** based on your data type.
2. Create clear and informative graphs:
   - **Bar charts** for categorical comparisons.
   - **Line graphs** for time-based trends.
   - **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis.
3. Optimize charts with proper labels, colors, and legends.

---

### **Step 6: Data Storage** â¬œ

1. Choose a **database system** (e.g., MongoDB) for long-term storage.
2. Structure the database to efficiently store different data fields.
3. Save the processed data for easy retrieval and further analysis.

---

### **Step 7 (Bonus): Deploy with Streamlit** â¬œ

1. Develop an **interactive dashboard** for users to explore the data.
2. Add **filters, search functionalities, and real-time updates**.
3. Deploy the Streamlit app online for easy access.

---

## **4. Recommended Websites for Scraping**

Here are some suggested websites based on different types of data analysis:

- **Indeed.com** â€“ Scrape job postings, salaries, and company reviews.
- **BooksToScrape.com** â€“ Extract book titles, prices, and ratings.
- **IMDB.com** â€“ Analyze movie ratings, reviews, and trends.
- **OpenWeather API** â€“ Gather real-time weather data for different locations.
